# INSTRUCTIONS

Setting up and running Astralboot

# Getting boot data

The astralboot git repository has a default data folder that has a basic layout for booting.

run ln -s data_dist data , in the root directory for access to the file system directory

or for IPFS 

run ln -s refs.toml.dist refs.toml   and add IPFS=true to the config.toml file 

if you use this you will need to have a running IPFS node on the local machine.
